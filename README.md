Colors Lab
# Summary
This COLORS application combines API, HTML, CSS, and JS.  It will start at a login screen, where SQL will determine who can access past the login screen via username & password.  Past login, you can either add a color or search it.

# Technologies
Digital Ocean, GoDaddy, whatsmydns.net, Command Prompt, ARC, Developer tools.  To view code, it may be helpful to use VSCode to see what you are working or edit what you need before 'put'-ing the files into directories you add to the Droplet.  Know where you save the downloaded application items in your File Explorer.

# High-Level Setup Instructions
To run make the information accessible in an easy way, you can follow the steps I took: (1) Get a Droplet from DigitalOcean (buy whatever option works best for you), (2) get a Domain from GoDaddy and change the NS's & A type record from the default ones to DigitalOcean's (NS listed in Networking -> Domains and A type to IP address), (3) make sure to change the domain name cop4331-5.com listed in code.js to your http://YOURDOMAINNAME/LAMPAPI (or if that doesn't work use IP address instead of Domain Name), (4) use the Command Prompt to log into your Droplet via ssh root@DOMAINNAME or ssh root@IP, (5) use Incognito mode or something of the sort to view http://YOURDOMAINNAME in HTTP (NOT HTTPS).  If you are having problems to have the website show, check whatsmydns.net to see if the domain name is connected to your IP address.  After the steps above, you should be able to see the Login page, which has a grey background.  To view the rest of the page, log in as a user based on your mySQL input; for example, if you add a username as SamH and have a password of Test, you should be able to view past the Login page after entering those credentials.  If your password still does not work, where you can not get past the Login AND no error shows, check Developer tools.

# How to Run and Access the Application
Type in the Domain name or IP address from your Droplet or Domain in an Incognito browser, make sure it is HTTP.  You should be able to see the Login page, which has a grey background.  To view the rest of the page, log in as a user based on your mySQL input of valid users; for example, if you add a username as SamH and have a password of Test, you should be able to view past the Login page after entering those credentials.  If your password works, you should be moved over to the colors page, where you can either add or search a color that logged-in user has set up.  The information should save even if you log out of the session.

# Assumptions, Limitations, AI Usage (Class Policy)
You can look up how to CREATE a database & table and perform table inserts in the mySQL tied to the Droplet; you will likely have a different domain name, IP, and password to access the droplet - REMEMBER YOUR INFORMATION.  Know command line arguments like cat, cd, ls, vim, "insert" (i), exit, :wq & :q, mkdir, etc..  You cannot view the website in HTTPS unless you get additional features to allow for that.  The information will only be slightly modified to fit your IP, DNS, and password for "TheBeast", though the according changes to the files - based on my information - should not show in this GitHub; it should be the original files before my modifications.  All of my work was done in Windows, a different computer could mean unique challenges.  If adding or modifying using AI, as per class policy, make sure to claim how the AI was used FOR your work, as it is not your own work and one should give credit when it is due.
